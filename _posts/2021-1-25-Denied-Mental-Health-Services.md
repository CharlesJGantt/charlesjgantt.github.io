title: Denied Mental Health Services
---

So this journal entry is not part of my daily updates, but is going to serve as a place for me to rant a little about the broken mental health system in this country. 

Today I had an appointment with our local county-run mental health clinic. I specifically chose this clinic because I was told that they would provide me service after the suicide intervention for next to nothing as I am jobless and have zero income. When I scheduled the appointment last Tuesday, I was told on the phone, and even received a conformation email that my sessions would cost somewhere between $2 and $12 as I do not have any form of income at the moment. 

So 1:30 rolls around this afternoon, and a lady calls me to register me into the system, and she ask me to put a credit card on file or consent to paper billing. I asked if she could confirm what todays session was going to cost, and she said "somewhere between $89 and $235, it depends on what the Dr does during the session." When I asked her about the previous quote of $2-$12, she said that the discounted services were only for people on welfare assistance or who worked very low income jobs. I pointed out again that I was unemployed and requested the reduced rates, but she told me that in order to receive the discount I had to have a job or be on welfare. 

How fucking backwards is that shit? For someone who was hesitant to talk to a "professional" in the first place, this really makes me lose faith in the system, and confirms my bias that even a county-funded program is nothing more than a money grab that preys on the mentally sick and poor. She told me that whoever I talked to last Tuesday, and whoever sent the conformation email got it wrong, and that her hands were tied, and without any way to pay, they would not be able to talk to me today, and then she wished me luck and ended the call. 

I was really looking forward to talking to someone because that is what everyone keeps telling me to do, but even if I get the job I applied for last Wednesday, there is no way I can afford a $235/week bill.  That amounts to a full house payment every month. These people have to be out of their mother fucking minds. This is small-town Aiken SC, where the median household income is just over $27,000. These people want $12,220/year to receive mental health counseling that my tax money already subsidizes. That's almost half of the average household income here. 

So one of the most important things to recover from depression is to develop a plan, and to build routines that make life easier. I'm not going to let this set me back, I am going to continue moving forward and upward with every passing day. You can't let little things like this that are out of your control get to you, or set you back. I'm a very introspective and analytical person, and I can identify many of my flaws myself when I am not stuck in a deep depression, and I feel that as long as I can continue to do that I will be ok. 

I've made a lot of progress over the last week, and I know that I can continue making great progress every week. It just sucks that the system constantly fails those who need it the most. Two years ago I would have told someone who was seeking help to go talk to someone at Aiken Barnwell Mental Health, but I'm not sure I could make that recommendation now. I would urge anyone from the Aiken area to contact Aurora or Aiken Regional if you are in need of immediate mental health help. Aiken Barnwell is just another failed government subsidized program that benefits no one but the Dr's who work there.
