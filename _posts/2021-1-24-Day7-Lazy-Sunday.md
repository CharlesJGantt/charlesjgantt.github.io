title: Day 7 - Lazy Sunday
---

I woke up with my alarm this morning, and resisted the urge to hit snooze, but I did lay in bed for a little bit petting Toast who was laying on my chest, and Bowie who was laying beside me. These animals have been such a rock for me emotionally, and all three of them can tell when I am feeling down, and I know this because they always try to snuggle me, even if I am sitting in my office chair. I'm very thankful to have them in my life. 

I'm goin to be upfront with everyone, this journal entry is going to be fairly short compared to others because I honestly didn't do much today other than watch some YouTube, and cook a big pot of chili for dinner. 

I did spend about an hour this morning doing some general cleaning around the house, and I had to tackle one thing I absolutely hate cleaning, and that's Toast's litter box. It wasn't bad with just him, but it was not very much fun at all. I'm beginning to work out how to automate that process, and maybe that will become a new project for YouTube in the future. 

Lunch was fairly boring as well but consisted of a Cesar salad and some celery sticks I had left over from a previous meal in the week. I forget how much I love fresh celery sticks dipped in ranch dressing. Just before lunch I put on a big crockpot of my 3-bean chili, and I let it cook for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, even after eating lunch, the aroma of the chili kept me hungry all day, and by dinner time, I was starving. 

My afternoon was basically void of anything important other than taking care of the puppers when they needed to go outside, and a little putzing around with my green house controller project. I wanted to do more, but I had to force myself to relax and just take some time to unwind after all of the events of the past week. This was way harder than I thought it would be, but I eventually picked up the guitar and spent about an hour and  a half working on cords. 

The chili took a little longer to finish than expected, but to say it was perfect would be an understament. Maybe I'm biased, or maybe I was just that hungry after having to smell it all day, but it may have been the best chili I have ever made. I topped it off with a pan of fresh corn bread and a glass of cold 0-calorie lemonade. 

I talked to Mer around 7pm and she was finishing up dinner as well. We didn't talk long, but she let me know that she would be bringing Toast, and the pupper's flea treatment over one day this week, so that is another load off of my mind. I new it was getting close to the time where they will need it. My backyard is very sandy, and it seems to grow fleas like it grows grass, plus I no longer have any backyard chickens to help control the insects back there. 

Part of me wanted to play video games last night, and another part of me wanted to just zone out on YouTube, but my conscious forced a compromise. I spent the rest of the evening watching videos while I worked on redesigning the case that will house my green house controller's electronics. I'm getting quite proficient in Fusion 360, and I redesigned the entire case three times last night until I came up with something I was pleased with. I'm going to 3D print it sometime tomorrow. 

Speaking of tomorrow, I am pretty nervous, excited, and afraid all at the same time. I'm expecting to hear back from the local software company that I applied at last week. I know the interview went well, but I'm still nervous about my chances at getting the job. That's just my normal worrisome self, and I definitely need to work on that. 

That's going to wrap things up for this entry. I wish I had more to write about, but today was truly a lazy Sunday for me, and I needed the rest and relaxation. Thank you again for following along with my journey of recovering from depression. I know I say this in every entry, but your continued support and love throughout this ordeal is part of the fuel that has powered this transformation in my life, and because of that, I am forever grateful. 

One quick note, I have had a few of you reach out and ask why I quit posting on my AMakersWeightLossJourney Instagram account. I haven't given up, my scale just died, and it uses a weird battery that I had to order from Amazon. It will be here tomorrow, and I will begin posting there again. 

## Today I'm Thankful For

Today I'm thankful for the clarity and understanding this whole ordeal has brought into my life. A week ago I felt like my whole life was crashing down around me, and I had no way to pull myself out of the rubble, but here I am several days later, and I have never been more confident that everything is going to be ok. With the prospect of a new job on the horizon, and my rekindled love of the guitar, I will have plenty of distractions to keep me busy during those hard moments where my feelings surface and things get tough. 

Last weekend a happy future seemed extremely far away, if not impossible altogether, but I know in my heart that no matter what happens next, I am going to remain true to myself, and will continue to be the best person I can possibly be. I have to make that my number one priority, not only for myself, but for my pets, my mother, and all of you who have been there for me over this past week.
