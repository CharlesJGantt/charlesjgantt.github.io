title: Day 9 - My First Off Day 
---

I woke up this morning about an hour and a half earlier due to Bowie basically sitting on my head shaking like he had just seen a ghost. Bowie is extrememly afraid of any sudden loud noises, making thunderstorms and fireworks a very bad time for him. We had storms push through this morning, and the thunder had scared him so much he was trying to be as close to me as possible, and that aparently meant sitting on my head while I snore away. 

I tried to console him there in the bed but he was just having none of it, so I got out of bed, got dressed, and put his "hug shirt" on. A hugh shirt is a simple shirt that is stretchy, and utilizes velcro to hold it tight around a dogs body. From what Mer told me, it gives them a sense of calm, as if you were hugging them constantly. It works so well with Bowie that it almost completelty calms him down. I settled down in my office after finishing my morning routien, and he spent the rest of the morning laying at my feet under my desk. 

When things calmed down around noon, I let the dogs out to do their thing, and once they came back inside, I decided to go drive my truck a few miles to work more fuel injector cleaner through the injectors. The check engine light stayed off the entire drive, so I suspect the cleaner worked, and the #1 injector was just a little sticky from not being used much lately. I've used Lucal Oil Fuel Injector Cleaner for years on everything from my first car, to my old drag race car, and several other vehicles since, and it always seems to take care of injector issues. It's good stuff. 

Once back home I warmed myself a bowl of chili, and settled down in my office to work on more video editing. I recoded a lot of voice over, and began mastering that in Davinci Resolve's Fairlight workspace. It's a lot different than Adobe Audition, but the fundamental concepts I learned with Audition still apply to Fairlight. I feel like I prefer Audition much more over fairlight, but that could just be from my unfamiliarity with Fairlight as I have used Audition for years. 

My cousin stopped by last night to give me an impromtu guitar lesson, and some of the techniques he showed me definitely helped. Catching up with him was the best part of the visit though as we don't get to hang out much these days. We grew up down the road from each other, and pretty much spent every day after school fishing together, hunting, building forts in the woods, and just being country kids in general. He's one of the very few people left in my life who was there to see how I grew up, and all of the hardships we faced. I really need to make more time for him this year. 

Speaking of my cousin and fishing, it's almost time to begin thinking about how much time this year I am going to spend bass fishing. A lot of people think that making things is my main hobby, and while that may be true certain times of the year, bass fishing has been my number one passion since I was old enough to hold a fishing rod. I actually had ambitions of going pro at one point in my life, and had the acolades to make that happen, we just didn't have the money to make it happen. 

After hanging out at squirrel's place the other night, my cousin visiting, and a slew of new Googan Squad videos on YouTube, the bass fever is beginning to take over. I think the water will be warming up enough around the end of Feb, to begin hitting the water as much as I can. I have a little "bass buggy" style pond boat I like to fish out of, but I want to put some work into it before fishing season gets here. I'll talk more about that in a future journal entry, and there will be some YouTube videos made around this boat thanks to a very cool sponsor that reached out last fall. 

Once my cousin left, I went back to editing video, but my drive to continue fizzled out quickly, and I spent another hour or so gaming before deciding to turn in for the night. I did speek to Mer today, and it sounds like she too had a bad start to her morning due to the rain, but it sounded like things leveled off some as the day progressed. I miss her more and more every day, but talking to her definitely helps. I'm no longer crying when we hang up, but I still feel a twinge of pain every time. 


## Today I'm Thankful For

Today I'm thankful for hobbies. I've struggled with ADD my entire life, and spent most of my childhood mellowed out by Ritilin, but it's never been easy for me to focus on boring things, even when medicated. My hobbies over the years have really helped to teach me paitence and focus, but more importantly, they have given me the opportunity to teach myself new skills quickly because I am able to hyper focus on those things. This is why programming is failry easy for me to learn, and why I took to wood turning so fast. These things interest me greatly, and forwhatever reason, that interest is able to bridge the gap between my foucs and attention.
