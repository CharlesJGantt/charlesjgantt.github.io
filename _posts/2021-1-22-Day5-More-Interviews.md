title: Day 5 - More Interviews
---


Today was the first day that I felt like I have my morning routine worked out well enough that I don't need to continue to adjust things. The only thing I need to modify now is moving my wakeup alarm from 8 am to 6 am. The puppers seemed exceptionally hungry this morning, and I think it was because I kept the bedroom door closed last night in an attempt to retain some heat in the room, and they were not able to go out and get water last night. I'll remember that tonight. 

This morning was finalizing the video I've been working on, as well as prepping for two job interviews I had today. I'm hoping for the local company to hire me, and for one of these other two companies to hire me for some contract writing I can do in the evenings and on the weekends for the time being. The extra income would be a welcome thing, that's for sure. 

The first company I interviewed with today was a bit bland and boring, and the HR lady who interviewed me over the zoom call just seemed to hate her job, and she actually knew very little about the roll I had applied for. I finished the review with very little confidence that it would turn into anything, but who knows, it could be something. 

The second company was right up my alley and they actually approached me, not the other way around. Apparently, a very large open source hardware organization recommended me for the contract work they needed done. The CEO and I were scheduled for a 30-minute call and it ended up lasting for an hour and a half, and by the end we were chatting like old friends, so I feel good about this one. 

I spoke to Mer this evening, and it sounded like she had a long and semi-frustrating day at work, but she is stopping by tomorrow for a bit, so I am looking forward to that. It will be good to see her for the first time in a couple of days. 

I'm going to end this blog post a little early tonight as I need to head out into my workshop and begin setting up to cut 50 soap dishes for an order that was placed today. I will have more of my turning's up on Etsy over the weekend and will share that link with everyone Monday morning.

## Today I'm Thankful For: 

Today I'm thankful for one of my best friends, Curtis. Many years ago I joined a computer modification forum called The Best Case Scenario. It was a popular website where PC enthusiast from around the world modified their computers and shared their progress in the form of chronological worklogs. My interest in computer hardware was growing, and I really wanted to break into the hardware review world, but had no idea how to reach that goal. 

While sitting at the hospital with my grandmother one evening, I wrote a short tutorial on how to use a resistor to dim LED lights for use as accents inside PC cases, and Curtis and a guy named John, took notice and asked me if I wanted to write for the website. 

Up until this point I had not written much other than some wiring harness documentation at a Camaro enthusiast forum. I accepted their offer and wrote some short articles on member's projects, but quickly transitioned into writing hardware reviews. Curtis and John allowed me to reach out to hardware manufacturers and solicit new components to review on the website.

I was promoted to the websites Editor in Chief and wrote several dozen reviews in my time there. I brought several of the site's prominent members onto the review staff, and we were somewhere in the top 10 PC hardware review websites on the internet at the time. Manufacturers were tripping over themselves to send us the latest and greatest PC hardware components as our reviews were quite popular. 

That was how I got my start in technical writing and content creation. I had always thought I would spend my life on construction sites, or in the construction industry doing something, but that simple gesture of letting me forge a review program with a team of like-minded enthusiast quite literally defined my life for the next decade and a half. Curtis is the reason I started The Makers Workbench, and is ultimately the reason I have had so many successful technical writing jobs over the years. 

Curtis was there for me when my home burnt down in 2012, and he's been there for everything since. I haven't quite been the friend I should have been to Curtis over this past year, and I know that my actions and attitude have frustrated him, but just like my friend Will, Curtis was there for me last Saturday despite my actions towards him recently. I could not have asked for god to put such a good friend in my life, and I doubt I will ever find another who is as good to me as he is. 

That's going to wrap up this entry. I'll be back with another tomorrow. Thank you again for your support, words of encouragement, and love that all of you have shown me.
