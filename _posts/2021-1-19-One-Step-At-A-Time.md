title: Day 2 - One Step At A Time
---


I want to take a moment to rewind things to last night. Mer stopped by to pick up some things she forgot, and to see me for a minute. Lucy had been sad most of the day as was definitely grieving over her pack being gone. Since Mer works in the animal care field, I asked her if there was anything I could do to help cheer Lucy up. We talked about it for a few minutes and she decided to bring Bowie, our little black and tan hound back over. This warmed my heart so much, because I have missed him dearly. So I have that to look forward to this evening. Now on to today. 

I woke up this morning to my alarm ringing 20-minutes earlier than yesterday. Setting the alarm 20-minutes early was part of my plan to return to a 6am wakeup time.  Rolling over, I stared at Mer's side of the bed for a few minutes while I ran through the list of things in my head that I needed to do today. Her not being there was still saddening, but I know in my heart that things will be ok. 

I fed Lucy, Toast, and the other two cats that are still here (they are being taken to Mer's new place this weekend) 

Breakfast was once again a keto-friendly combination of three sausage patties, two eggs, and a glass of water. I let Lucy out into the back yard to do her morning thing while I ate. I've begun handwashing my dishes instead of putting them in the dishwasher. Without Mer here, there's no reason to waste the energy the dish washer would use on just a few plates and spoons. It was actually somewhat therapeutic to stand in the window with the sun beaming in watching the cars pass down the street in front of the house.

I left Lucy out while I took a very hot shower. I had been cold all night again as I have still not grasp the fact that there is much less body heat in the bed at night with Mer and the other three puppers gone. I have to remember to pull out a second blanket tonight. I continued listening to Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules For Life during breakfast and throughout my shower.  

Early to mid morning was filled with what I call "office chores," but was really me checking email, working on finishing up editing the video I mentioned yesterday, and responding to so many of you who continue to reach out hourly to see if I am doing ok. I can not express my gratitude enough for what that means to me. 

Sometime around 11am my best friend and his father stopped by to drop off a used treadmill for me. It's not in working condition, and needs a lot of replacement parts, but I don't care about that, I am going to harvest its motor and motor driver circuitry, and am going to use those parts to build a large, maybe 16-inch disc sander for my woodworking workshop. For now, the treadmill is going to live in my storage shed until I get a few free hours to break it down and remove the components I want to keep. 

Lunch today was a pair of hamburger patties with cheese on top, followed with a bottle of water and some 0-calorie flavoring. I need to research more Keto-friendly meal ideas. During lunch I decided to watch a few YouTube videos as I am cutting back on that greatly. Previous to the incident last Saturday, I would watch anywhere between 40 and 70 videos a day on YouTube. I have watched a total of 19 since Saturday. 

I decided to take a break from the office early this afternoon and spend 30-minutes organizing and cleaning my workshop. A close friend is placing an order for a bunch of hardwood soap dishes for her soap making company, and I really want to have the workshop tidy and in order when I fire up my CNC Router to make them. 

I have a job interview tomorrow with a friend's software development business, and I was asked to apply for a Content Strategist position at another tech company. Both are great possibilities, and I have friends at both who have put in good words for me. I would really like to land the first job because it is a in-office position whereas the second 

I also finally worked out the details of the new counseling I have been looking forward to. The office called me back and scheduled an appointment  for this coming Monday. That's actually a huge load off of my mind because I heard that they were extremely backed up, but I guess post SI cases take some sort of a priority. All of the sessions will be remote for now, and it may be 6-10 weeks before they can get me in for an in-person session, but the remote sessions will help a lot I'm sure. 

I'm writing this post a little early as well because I want to go to bed early again tonight to be well rested and have time to prepare for tomorrows interview. Mer just messaged me to let me know that she would be over with Bowie in a bit, and I am extremely excited to hug that little pupper when he gets here. That is definitely going to bring a lot of fresh light into my life! I can't thank Mer enough for bringing him back to me, and I know its tough on her to give him to me, but she knows that Lucy needs her friend, and she knows how much I need him too. I owe her a serious debt of gratitude for this. 

Before I close this out for the night, I want to take a moment and put down some of my thoughts about the breakup. 

I wont lie, it was the most painful emotional experience of my life, and it still hurts. It's likely going to hurt for a while still. However, I am extremely grateful that Mer had the courage to make that hard decision. I know it was extremely hard for her to do, but it was something that needed to happen. I had broken her down to the point that she was not the person I met seven years ago. To her credit, I haven't been the same man she had fallen in love with in a very long time either. 

I spoke with a friend today who went through a very rough breakup with her husband whom she spent the last 15 years with. While what I put Mer through was mental and verbal, my friend had to endure physical abuse, and watch the physical abuse of their kid as well. When she told me about some of the things she felt, and how his actions affected her, I realized that Mer was going through the same thing. Abuse is abuse, mental or physical, it all hurts, it all damages us in ways we cant explain, and the damage done to the relationship is the same no matter what. 

Listening to her tell me about that today really opened my eyes to what kind of bastard I had been to Mer for so long, and that realization broke me down to tears today. Mer is the love of my life, and I've had a bit of a rough time today working through what I have put her through. The realization that I hurt her as bad as I did has led me to reevaluate a lot of the things I believe about relationships and how they should work. Putting your partner in life through emotional trauma is unacceptable and inexcusable at any time, for any reason. 

I've said this throughout this blog, but I love Mer more than I can express in words, and the realization that my actions have cost me the love of my life have solidified a very powerful lesson on my mind and in my heart. I am going to fight as hard as I can to win her heart back , and to earn her faith, trust and respect all over again. I used to think that the greatest achievement in my life would be building a business, or gaining some form of  notoriety on YouTube, when in reality I had already achieved greatness on the day that Mer agreed to be my partner in life.  That makes the loss of her my greatest failure. 

Mer, if you read this, I want you to know that I took your words to heart, I am going to become the man you fell in love with again, and I am going to become the greatest life partner you could ever want for. I'm sorry I fucked it all up, but I am going to show you through hard work that I can do it. It's going to take time for us both to heal, but I have never been more excited, nor more dedicated and focused than I am now. 

### Today I'm Thankful For: 


Today I'm thankful for my best friend, Will. He's been there for me throughout so much over the last decade, and I would not be where I am skill wise if it were not for him. He's always there for me when I need someone, and he doesn't hesitate to tell me when I am being stupid, or stubborn. I've been a bit of a dick to him over the last few months as well, and I know my actions have caused him a great deal of emotional pain, grief, and frustration, but he still stands by my side regardless of my transgressions against him. I'm so thankful for him, and having him in my life is a blessing I am eternally thankful for.

That's it for day 2. I want to thank everyone who has been following along, reaching out, and praying for me. I could not do this without your support, prayers, and well wishes.
