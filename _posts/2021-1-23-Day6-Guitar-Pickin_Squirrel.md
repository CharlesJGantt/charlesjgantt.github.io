title: Day 6 - Guitar Pickin Squirrel
---


Today marks one week since the SI incident and I what a change one week makes. I want to write a long blog post about my progress over the past week, but I am going to save that for Monday's blog. Today's morning routine was much the same except for feeding Toast. He has a condition that requires daily medication that's mixed into his morning food. I had ran out of the pre-prepared food nuggets Mer had made before moving out, and was waiting on her to come over later today to show me how to mix it properly. 

I spent most of my free time this morning catching up on some YouTube videos, emails from friends, and I worked some on a small automation system I am designing for my small greenhouse.  I have all of the hardware working as it should, I just need to finish up the data acquisition and storage part of the project. It's been a fun project, but I admit that I have lost some of my drive to finish it since Mer left. I'm sure that drive will come back as soon as spring begins to arrive. 

Mer came over this afternoon and spent some time cleaning up her old craft room, and to spend some time with me and the puppers. We talked about the past week, the progress we have both made with ourselves, and what the future may hold, but it was mostly friendly chat like old times. I really miss having her around to talk to. It's the little things like random 30-second conversations that you never realize meant so much to you until they are no longer happening. 

Mer spent about two hours here before she had to go back to her new place, and while her leaving is always tough on me, I knew I had other things to finish up and I just busied myself with them for the next hour or so. Some friends had invited me over to their place to hang out and pick up a guitar they were going to let me borrow, and I headed over to their place around 6pm. 

I've known Squirrel (his actual nickname) since we were both kids. We grew up in the same rural "neighborhood" and he lived on a pond that I fished almost every day of my youth. We rode dirt bikes and quads together, we played paintball together, and built forts in the woods together. He's one of my oldest friends, and even after 30-years of being friends, we still chat for hours on end every time we see each other. He let me borrow the acoustic guitar that he learned to play on and gave me a quick lesson before I had to head home for the night. 

I drove home pretty excited as I used to play a little when I was a teenager, but I never took it seriously enough to even learn cords, I just played with tabs, and thought I was good. I was not... Once I arrived home, I loaded up a few YouTube videos and spent the next two hours learning the first four cords, and struggling with finger placement. My tender fingers were so sore after a couple hours that I had to stop and then spent an hour or so playing some video games with Will.  

Last night was the latest I have stayed up in over a week, and I'm definitely paying for it this morning. I apologize for this update being late, but here it is. Thanks again for following along with my journey through the toughest time in my life. I appreciate all the love and support from everyone. 


## Today I'm Thankful For


Today I'm thankful for life-long friends. Spending some time tonight with Squirrel and his wife was a breath of fresh air (for lack of better words) and I really enjoyed myself. Like I mentioned above, I've known squirrel my whole life, and we have never once had any sort of falling out, never had a real argument, and we've always been there for each other. He is one of the very few people left in my life who knows how I grew up, and he knows how much that "neighborhood" means to me. Whenever I want to go fishing for a few hours, I simply have to drive over to his house, put my boat in the water, and no one says a word about it, and similarly, if I just want to hangout and talk for a few hours, I simply need to show up. I'm forever grateful to have Squirrel and his wife in my life.
