title: Day 8 - A New Week
---

I had planned on writing a lengthy update today but its just too late to do that, but I will hit the highlights, and talk about a low-point. 

My morning routine is becoming second nature, and the animals seem to have settled into their new feeding schedule fairly well too. Bowie and Lucy are no longer being hyper protective over their respective food bowls, and toast is serving as the "Feeding Time Alarm." If I'm even 5-minutes late feeding, he will let me know. 

I had to mail a package off, so I went to the post office mid-morning and got that taken care of. Instead of going straight home, I noticed my check engine light on, so I drove around the corner to Auto Zone and had them run a scan. The fuel injector for my truck's #1 cylinder was pulling high-current, meaning it was either hard to open or the tiny coil inside was malfunctioning. With injectors costing upwars of $150 for an OEM replacement, I opted to try the $13 repaiur option, and running some Lucas Oil Fuel Injector Cleaner through a few tanks of gas before ordering an injector. I needed gas anyway, so I added twice the recommended amount of injector cleaner in to my tank and headed to a fuel station. After fuling up, I drove around for about 20-minutes to make sure some of the injector cleaner made it to the fuel injectors before driving home. Time will tell if it worked or not. 

I had two appointments scheduled today with a local government-funded mental health facility, but ended up being denied services because I was unemployed, and not on welfare. Imagine a system that punishes those who have no income but actively interviewing for jobs and rewards those who are on welfare. It's completely backwards, and the fact that my taxes subsidize such a place does not sit well with me. Imagine doing the right thing and not taking from the system when you do not need it, and being penalized for that decision...  A friend reached out and told me about a foundation that might be able to help, and I plan on contacting them later this week. 

I'm not letting this little bump in the road set me back though, and even if that foundation is unable to help, I am going to continue moving forward and progressing positively every day. I was pretty mad about the situation, especially when the mental health facility told me to "well just get on food stamps or accept a minimum wage job, and we can offer you reduced fees." That's not who I am, and not how I was raised to be.  I work for what I have, and believe that hard work is the only path to not only success but personal redemption as well.  

I wanted to spend the rest of the day working on a YouTube video, but I just could not sit in my office any longer, so I put on my headphones, and spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in my workshop prepping soap dish blanks for an order a friend from Michigan placed last night. I rounded out the evening with a warm bowl of Chili, and after feeding the animals and cleaning Toast litter box, I settled down for a couple of hours of gaming with Will. 


## Today I'm Thankful For

Today I'm thankful for my ability to learn new skills quickly and rather effortlessly. I've been playing with PHP code ever since I began prepping for that job interview last Wednesday, and it's starting to make more sense with every day. While I'm not working on it every day, I am dedicating an hour or so every other day to online PHP lessons. I'm also learning cords on the guitar quicker than I expected, but I am still having trouble with my fingers becoming sore just a few minutes into practice, but I know that will change as I develop callouses on my fingers. 

When I feel good about my PHP skills, I am going to move on to mastering microPython, which seems to be the future of small microcontrollers. I am fairly proficient in Python already, so this will not be that big of a challenge, but it should prove to be fun.
