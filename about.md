A Makers Journey
Hello, I’m Charles, a maker, artist, writer, and technologist. This is my story chronicling my recovery from a very dark time in my life. I’m writing this blog to detail the hardest journey I will ever have to take. I’m doing this first and foremost for myself as a way to collect my thoughts, and have something I can reference back to when I am having a bad day. I’m bringing you along in hopes that someone who might be dealing with a dark period in their life might see this and seek out help from someone. It’s never as bad as it seems, and all we can do is take it one day at a time and ensure that every day is better than the previous day.

I’m going to try to update this blog daily, and it’s likely not going to be very interesting to most, but I hope that this helps someone who might be feeling the same way I was.

If you are having suicidal thoughts please call the suicide prevention line at 1-800-273-8255.
